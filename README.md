# Operation "Valkyrie"

This is my BobbyBroccoli-style 3D presentation for a uni project (and also my first proper GitHub repo). Instead of following a strictly-scripted route, this presentation gives you a direct control over what and when to show.

## Build

1. Install export templates for Godot if you haven't already:
`Editor -> Manage export templates -> Download and install`
2. Export!
`Project -> Export`

**Alternatively**, you may just run the precompiled `.exe` file in the top-level directory.

## Usage

This is supposed to go with a text, but I unfortunately deleted it. Really, it was just my paraphrasing of Wikipedia, so you haven't lost much.

1. **Start the intro** by pressing Enter and wait for 20 seconds while it reveals my personal information. *Intro can be disabled* by ticking off `Valkyrie.tscn/Valkyrie [node]/Play Intro`.
2. From there you're free to go wherever. **Bindings** are as follows:
8 - 1938
9 - 1939
1 - 1941
2 - 1942
3 - 1943 overview
↳ E - 1943 Q1
↳ R - 1943 Q2
↳ D - 1943 Q3
↳ F - 1943 Q4
A - assassination [aka June 1944]
H - Hitler
S - von Stauffenberg
3. To reveal data in blocks, press Enter. *1939 and 1941 blocks are supposed to be static.*
